After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia , in 1081 he led an army of 30 , 000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania , capturing Valona , Kanina , Jericho ( Orikumi ) , and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages . They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea , devastating everything along the way . Under these harsh circumstances , the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans . The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival . Immediately before the battle , the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city .
